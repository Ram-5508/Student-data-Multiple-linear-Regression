# Student-data-Multiple-linear-Regression
The dataset contains three variables- Math, Reading and Writing. It is said that the students who are good at Math is also good at Writing.

So we are gonna use multiple linear regression to predict the Writing score from Math and Reading scores.

In this program Variance Inflation factor is done to determine if there is relationship between different variables. Then Linear regression is used to predict the Writing score. And Ordinary least square is also done at the end to determine the contribution of independent variables with the dependent variables
